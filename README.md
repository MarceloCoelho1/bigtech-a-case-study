## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide a detailed, step-by-step case study on how to build a scalable and efficient e-commerce platform similar to Amazon. Each module is self-contained, focusing on a specific aspect of the platform, making it easier to understand, develop, and test independently.

**Note:** This project is primarily intended for educational purposes, including my own learning journey. I am not affiliated with Amazon, Google, Facebook, or any other big tech company. I am undertaking this project solely to improve my knowledge. Therefore, implementations may not mirror those of industry giants like Amazon, but I will strive to do my best. This also allows beginners to study and learn from the project. **Contributions and feedback are always welcome!**
